# NLog adapter for Unity container
Unity extension to integrate with popular [NLog](https://github.com/nlog/nlog) logger.

## Getting Started
- Reference the `Unity.NLog ` package from NuGet.
```
Install-Package Unity.NLog 
```

## Registration:
- Add `NLogExtension` extension to the container

```C#
container = new UnityContainer();
container.AddNewExtension<NLogExtension>();
```
- Where required add `ILogger` interface to resolved constructor. 

```C#
public class LoggedType
{
    public LoggedType(ILogger log)
    {
    }
  ...
}
```

- If you want to custom the extension (In this case, get only the class name instead of the full name), you have to 
instantiate NLogExtension to set properties and add this extension to Unity

```C#
var ext = new NLogExtension{
    GetName = (t, n) => t.Name
};
container.AddExtension(ext);
```

- Log normally...
